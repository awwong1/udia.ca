There was a quaint 'get it done' air to describe today's convocation ceremony.

At 10AM MST, the [`ualberta.ca`](https://ualberta.ca) homepage updated to celebrate the graduating class of 2021.
Three pre-recorded YouTube videos (different partitioning of students by loose faculty similarity) were presented.
The [hour and twenty seven minute long Spring Convocation 2021 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0A3dYMQXvA&t=521s) (containing the Faculty of Science) had the conventional singing of the national anthem, address, and presentation of names.
Searching your name, you found [a nifty visualization with animated students waiving their hats and scrolls at the bottom of the screen](https://www.ualberta.ca/convocation/graduates.html?search0=Alexander+Wong&details=alexander-william-wong).
An email was sent out containing links to an online 'digital degree parchment', where [a third party authority (MyCreds) will present the diploma/certificate PDF](https://learner.mycreds.ca/sharelink/c9258ddf-395e-4f17-a60f-36a4f74c2a5a/3fa95fa5-c2d5-47bb-9352-4b966a8464d3).

I downloaded the PDF and carried on with my day, feeling just a little bit older.
