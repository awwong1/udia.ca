The following are some quick lessons learned from setting up a Linux developer laptop from scratch. These points are my own personal preferences, intended to be a reference for when I have to do this again.

# Personal Computing Operating System, Desktop Environment, Hardware

I really enjoy using [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) with [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/).
My personal computing devices use the Testing/Unstable distributions.
~~Currently, I am using a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2015) as my hardware.~~
I am in the process of switching my daily driver to a Lenovo C740, running Debian Buster.

Aside: I have had a relatively positive experience with the Dell XPS13 9360. Unfortunately a capacitor popped rendering the screen unusable. That laptop served me for roughly two years (May 2018 - Mar 2020), so I am slightly disappointed with its durability/longevity.

## KDE Additional Setup (System Settings)

### Linking to Binaries

Example uses for [the latest stable Firefox binary](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/).

1. Decompress the archives into `/opt` for system-wide installation, or `~/opt` for the current user only.
2. Create a file `firefox-stable.desktop` (replace `stable` with `beta`/`nightly`,) in the:
    - `/usr/share/applications` directory for system-wide installation
    - `~/.local/share/applications` directory for current user installation

```text
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Firefox Stable
Comment=Web Browser
Exec=/opt/firefox/firefox %u
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Icon=/opt/firefox/browser/chrome/icons/default/default128.png
Categories=Network;WebBrowser;
MimeType=text/html;text/xml;application/xhtml+xml;application/xml;application/vnd.mozilla.xul+xml;application/rss+xml;application/rdf+xml;image/gif;image/jpeg;image/png;x-scheme-handler/http;x-scheme-handler/https;
StartupNotify=true
```

Update the paths accordingly.

Retrieve the cold storage private keys and import them: `gpg --import Alexander\ William\ Wong\ \(0FC4B4EE\)\ â€“\ Secret.asc`
```text
gpg: key 0F8D1FA50FC4B4EE: public key "Alexander William Wong (Master)" imported
gpg: key 0F8D1FA50FC4B4EE: "Alexander William Wong (Master)" not changed
gpg: key 0F8D1FA50FC4B4EE: secret key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 2

gpg:              unchanged: 1

gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
```

You should have the following: `gpg --list-keys --with-keygrip`

Remove the private master encryption key from the keyring:
`gpg --edit-key alex@udia.ca`

gpg> key 1      # selects the key that does not have expiry date
gpg> delkey     # delete the key
gpg> trust      # set own key to ultimate trust
gpg> passwd     # modify the password from cold-storage password to something more friendly
gpg> save
```

This key should now be removed from the private keyring. Remove the cold storage and appropriate files.
