This page is about `udia.ca`; for information about the author, see [about]({{< ref "posts/about.md" >}}).

# Overview

UDIA came into existence in February 2016, largely as a result of being one of the few domain names available in the ['.ca' TLD](https://cira.ca/) satisfying a four character length limit.
It is also my preferred online pseudonym.

## Content

There is currently very little to no content on this site, but I intend of keeping various public notes regarding computer science research (general neural network and deep learning experiments), instant pot pressure cooking recipes, and unimportant musings about life.

In an attempt to overcome crippling perfectionism, the quality of the published content may vary drastically.

## Audience

The goal of writing is to explain ideas and processes to my future self.
My target is the "I" who has forgotten, but remains engaged and intelligent.

# Miscellaneous

I borrow heavily from [gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net), which I discovered while browsing a Hacker News post of [well-designed personal sites](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21737529).

UDIA is not affiliated with the [Urban Development Institute of Australia](http://udia.com.au) in any way, shape, or form.
