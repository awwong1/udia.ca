# Preamble

A [**New Year's resolution**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_resolution) is a common western tradition where, at the start of the new calendar year, a commitment to lasting change is established.
These resolutions typically include changing an undesired behaviour (quitting smoking), accomplishing a personal goal (going to the gym consistently), or otherwise improving their life (become less offended by others).

By documenting my resolutions, I intend to have an accountable record to refer to when I review the events of the year 2020.
The resolutions that are proposed minimize dependence on external factors, and therefore remain primarily within my realm of control.

## Master's Degree

By the end of 2020, I aim to have a significant portion of my [master's degree thesis](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/graduate-studies/current-students/dissertation-guidelines) completed.
I will adhere to the [thesis preparation, requirements, and deadlines](https://www.ualberta.ca/graduate-studies/current-students/academic-requirements/thesis-requirement-and-preparation) set by the University of Alberta Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research.

If possible, my [final oral examination](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/graduate-studies/current-students/final-oral-exam-guidelines) (thesis defense) will have been scheduled/completed.

## At Least One App

By the end of the year, at least one high quality mobile application will be available to download from the popular mobile application distribution platforms ([Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps?hl=en), [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/)).

## Commitment to Health and Wellness

Throughout the year, I aim to commit to the following lifestyle changes:

1. Continue on the [Fast-5](https://www.fast-5.com/) **daily** intermittent fasting schedule.
  Currently, I have successfully fasted since December 22nd, 2019 with an eating window between 2pm and 7pm.

2. Maintain morning fitness routine with Bonnie.
I aim to complete at least one ten minute [FitnessBlender](https://www.fitnessblender.com/) exercise per day, **at least five days a week**.
Two days of arbitrary flex time per week are provided.

3. Sustain current bouldering (rock climbing) activity at the University.
The [Wilson Climbing Centre](https://www.ualberta.ca/kinesiology-sport-recreation/facilities/north-campus/wilson-climbing-centre) is free for students and walking distance from my lab.
While completing my MSc. thesis, **I will attend the climbing wall two times per week**, if available.

# Rubric

| Resolution        | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory | Good | Excellent |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|------|-----------|
| Master's Degree   | Thesis largely _incomplete_. Significant effort required (>3 months) for written dissertation. | Thesis requires _major revision_. Between 1-3 months of effort is necessary for dissertation pass and oral examination. | Thesis requires _minor revision_. Less than one month of effort is necessary for degree completion. | Thesis _complete_. Defense scheduled or completed. Convocation scheduled. |
| Mobile App        | No mobile application is published on any distribution platform. | One application is published onto the major distribution platforms. No other criteria satisfied. | One or more applications have been published. Applications have generally positive user feedback, and reviews. | More than one application has been published. Applications have positive user feedback, reviews, and monetary income. |
| Health & Wellness | Over 90 inexcusable skips or absences to the Fast-5, FitnessBlender, and Climbing Centre activities. | Between 60 and 90 inexcusable combined skips or absences. | Between 30 and 60 inexcusable combined skips or absences . | Less than 30 inexcusable skips or absences. |

## Health and Wellness Penalty Calculation

Scores are calculated every Sunday. Skipping one full week of fasting, fitness blender, and climbing would incur a penalty of:

$$ 
7_\text{Fast} + 5_\text{Fitness} + 2_\text{Climb} = 14_\text{Penalty Points}$$

Although inexcusable absences itself is subjective, the intention is to distinguish days where I did not perform a health and wellness activity due to laziness.

# Resolution Log

I will update this post every week until the end of 2020.

## January

Todo.
