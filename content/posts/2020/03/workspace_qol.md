The following are some quick lessons learned from setting up a Linux developer laptop from scratch. These points are my own personal preferences, intended to be a reference for when I have to do this again.

# Personal Computing Operating System, Desktop Environment, Hardware

I really enjoy using [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) with [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/).
My personal computing devices use the Testing/Unstable distributions.
Currently, I am using a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2015) as my hardware.

Aside: I have had a relatively positive experience with the Dell XPS13 9360. Unfortunately a capacitor popped rendering the screen unusable. That laptop served me for roughly two years (May 2018 - Mar 2020), so I am slightly disappointed with its durability/longevity.

## KDE Additional Setup

* `Virtual Desktops`: Number of desktops: 4.
    * `Desktop Switching`
        * Switch One Desktop to the Left: `Meta+Shift+Left`
        * Switch One Desktop to the Right: `Meta+Shift+Right`
    * `Global Shortcuts/System Settings Module`
        * Window One Desktop to the Left: `Meta+Alt+Shift+Left`
        * Window One Desktop to the Right: `Meta+Alt+Shift+Right`

* System Settings > Custom Shortcuts > Screenshots
    * Take Full Screen Screenshot: `Meta+Shift+3`
    * Take Rectangular Region Screenshot `Meta+Shift+4`
    * Take Active Window Screenshot: `Meta+Shift+Space`

* System Settings > Global Shortcuts > KWin
    * Maximize Window: `Meta+Shift+Up`

## Default Applications

* Browser: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
    * `about:config` > `ui.systemUsesDarkTheme`: 1
* Mail: [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/)
    * [Enigmail](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/enigmail/)
    * Optional: Remove KMail `sudo apt remove kmail`
* Text Editor: [vim](https://www.vim.org/)
* Code Editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 

### Linking to Binaries

1. Download the tarballs and extract contents into `/opt`.
2. Symlink the required binaries into `/usr/local/bin/`
3. Right click the KDE Icon (bottom left corner) and edit applications. Add the newly created symlinks, descriptions, icons.

Retrieve the cold storage private keys and import them: `gpg --import Alexander\ William\ Wong\ \(0FC4B4EE\)\ â€“\ Secret.asc`
```text
gpg: key 0F8D1FA50FC4B4EE: public key "Alexander William Wong (Master)" imported
gpg: key 0F8D1FA50FC4B4EE: "Alexander William Wong (Master)" not changed
gpg: key 0F8D1FA50FC4B4EE: secret key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 2

gpg:              unchanged: 1

gpg:   secret keys imported: 1

You should have the following: `gpg --list-keys --with-keygrip`

Remove the private master encryption key from the keyring:
`gpg --edit-key alex@udia.ca`

gpg> key 1      # selects the key that does not have expiry date
gpg> delkey     # delete the key
gpg> trust      # set own key to ultimate trust
gpg> passwd     # modify the password from cold-storage password to something more friendly
gpg> save
```

This key should now be removed from the private keyring. Remove the cold storage and appropriate files.
