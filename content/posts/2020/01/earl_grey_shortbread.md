## Ingredients

- **1 cup unsalted butter**, room temperature
- **3 bags Earl Grey tea leaves**, [President's Choice brand](http://www.presidentschoice.ca/en_CA/products/productlisting/pc-earl-grey-premium-black-tea.html) used
- **1/2 cup white granulated sugar**, [Rogers brand](https://www.lanticrogers.com/en/products/fine-white/) used
- **2 cups all purpose flour**, [Compliments brand](https://www.compliments.ca/en/product/all-purpose-flour-00055742511888/) used
- **1/2 tsp salt**, [Windsor iodized table salt](http://windsorsalt.com/products/table-salt-and-household-salt/)

## Instructions

1. Pulse the earl grey tea leaves until a fine powder is formed.
2. Blend the butter and earl grey tea leaves together. Mixture should sit at room temperature for at least 2 hours.
3. Cream the butter and tea mixture with the granulated sugar in a large bowl.
4. Add in the flour and salt. Mix until a uniform dough forms.
  The consistency should be crumbly and dry, but can hold shape when pressed together tightly.
5. Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and prepare a baking sheet with parchment paper.
5. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface until it is 1cm thick.
6. Cut the cookies using a 4cm diameter cookie cutter and place on the parchment paper.
  The cookies only need to be spaced such that they do not touch each other. Minimal cookie expansion occurs in the oven.
7. Bake on a parchment lined baking sheet for 18-20 minutes, or until the edges begin to turn golden brown.
8. Allow the cookies to cool down completely to room temperature before serving.

## Notes

* The longer the cookies sit, the more intense the flavour becomes.
* Shelf life is 2 weeks at room temperature, 2 months frozen.
* For extra fine earl grey tea leaves, use a mortar and pestle to grind the leaves.
