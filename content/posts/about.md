# Personal

My name is **Alexander Wong**.
I was born into the [millennial demographic cohort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials).
My first computer was the [Tandy 1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_1000), where I spent many summers playing old Sierra text adventure games like [Kings Quest](https://www.gog.com/game/kings_quest_1_2_3) and [Manhunter](https://www.mobygames.com/game/manhunter-new-york).

I am currently a graduate student at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/), [Department of Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science), living in [Alberta, Canada](https://www.alberta.ca/index.aspx).
I began pursuing my Master's degree in September 2018 due to a stubborn curiosity regarding the mechanisms of deep neural networks and their impressive results in image classification and segmentation tasks.

## Work

Prior to being a full-time graduate research assistant, I've developed software for multiple companies including [Pason Systems](https://www.pason.com/), [Telus Communications](https://www.telus.com/en/), [GoAuto](https://www.goauto.ca/), and [EPCOR](https://www.epcor.com/).
Additionally, I served as a teaching assistant for [CMPUT 404 - Web Applications and Architecture](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/undergraduate-studies/course-directory/courses/web-applications-and-architecture) and as a course developer for [CMPUT 497 - Introduction to Combinatorial Game Theory](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/undergraduate-studies/course-directory/courses/introduction-to-combinatorial-game-theory).
Before my training, I worked in the service industry as a waiter/bartender/banquet server; summered as a [Green Shack Coordinator](https://www.edmonton.ca/activities_parks_recreation/green-shacks.aspx); data-entry clerked for various offices; and served as customer facing IT support for [CARNA](https://nurses.ab.ca/).
