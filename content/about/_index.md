# Personal

My name is **Alexander Wong**.
I was born into the [millennial demographic cohort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials).
My first computer was the [Tandy 1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_1000), where I spent many summers playing old Sierra text adventure games like [Kings Quest](https://www.gog.com/game/kings_quest_1_2_3) and [Manhunter](https://www.mobygames.com/game/manhunter-new-york).

I am currently a graduate student at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/), [Department of Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science), living in [Alberta, Canada](https://www.alberta.ca/index.aspx).
I began pursuing my Master's degree in September 2018 due to a stubborn curiosity regarding the mechanisms of deep neural networks and their impressive results in image classification and segmentation tasks.
My research is currently in the classification and analysis of 12-lead electrocardiogram signals.
